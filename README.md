# UCL-stats-analysis-and-champion-prediction

<p><b>Goal:</b>
he purpose of this research was to analyze UCL's history in order to answer all potential queries regarding its statistics and to anticipate the current season champion based on those statistics.</p>

<p><b>About Data:</b>
The dataset contains UCL statistics for different teams from 1992-2020. The 'champions column' represent weather the team 
was champion or not in that year. 1 = champion, 0 = not champion.</p>
<p>
<b>My Approch:</b> The dataset was pretty straight forward. Didn't need much preprocessing. 
I have done a broad analysis with <i>pandas</i>, <i>seaborn</i>, <i>Matplotlib</i>. Several classifiers were used to create 
the model.
