# UCL-stats-analysis-and-champion-prediction

<p><b>Goal:</b>
The purpose of this research was to analyze UCL's history in order to answer all potential queries regarding its statistics and to anticipate the current season champion based on those statistics.</p>

<b>About Data:</b>
The dataset contains UCL statistics for different teams from 1992-2020. The `champions colum` represent weather the team 
was champion or not in that year. `1 = champion`, `0 = not champion`.</p>

<b>My Approch:</b> The dataset was pretty straight forward. Didn't need much preprocessing. 
I have done a broad analysis with <i>pandas</i>, <i>seaborn</i>, <i>Matplotlib</i>. Several classifiers were used to create 
the model.
